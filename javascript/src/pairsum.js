/**
* Finds two consecutive entries in a list (it doesnâ€™t have to be unique) that sum to a specified value.
*
* Input: A list of numbers. An example is [1, 9, 2, 4, 1, 4] and a specified target sum of 11.
* Output: The procedure will identify any of these pairs: (9, 2), (2, 9), (4, 7), or (7, 4).
* @function getPairBySum
* @param {Array} nums A one dimensional list of numerical values. An example is [1, 9, 2, 4, 1, 4]
* @param {Number} targetSum A number representing the target sum that we are searching for in the array of nums
* @yield {String} A pair of numbers found in the array nums that have a sum equal to targetSum.
