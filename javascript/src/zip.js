/**
* A generator function that accepts a 2-dimentional rectangular list and generates
* the sequence of elements returned one at a time of the transpose of the array 
* navigated in row-first order
*
* Input: A 2-d rectangular list. An example is [[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4]].
* Output: The sequence of the transpose. For the given example, the sequence is 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4.
* @function getZippedSequence
* @param {Array} nums 2-d rectangular list. An example is [[1, 2, 3], [6, 5, 4]]
* @yield {Number} A number from the zipped sequence. For the given example, the sequence is 1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4.
